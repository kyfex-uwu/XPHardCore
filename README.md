# XPHardCore
Plugin for Paper Minecraft Server, it do cool thing

Thx for checking out the GitHub for this project! XPHardCore is a 1.18.1 only (as of right now) Paper plugin that is survival Minecraft but with a twist: once you hit 0 levels, you're dead forever. >:3

Changes to vanilla:
 - If you die without having at least 1 level, you're set to spectator mode
 - When you die, you drop no XP
 - Every time you die, you lose 1 level
 - Experience points are capped at 30 levels (the level can be changed, and this restriction can be disabled)
